# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas on Trending YouTube Video Statistics

In this project, I utilized various resources including `numpy`, `re`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and more to perform Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on trending YouTube video statistics.

## Resources Used
- `numpy`
- `re`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `datetime`
- `glob`
- `os`
- `json`
- `pickle`
- `six`

Additionally, I set display options for Pandas to show all columns and rows and disabled chained assignments.

## Dataset
The project utilized the [YouTube Trending Video Statistics dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new) available on Kaggle. This dataset includes several months of data on daily trending YouTube videos from various countries including the USA, Great Britain, Germany, Canada, France, Russia, Mexico, South Korea, India, and Japan.

## Observations
The analysis focused on understanding user interactions with trending YouTube videos, which determine their rankings on the platform. Key observations include:

- Utilizing user interactions such as views, comments, and likes to identify trending videos.
- Ranking videos based on a ratio of views, likes, comments, and shares.
- Identifying the top trending videos in each country.
- Investigating the correlation between likes, dislikes, and comment counts.
- Analyzing the time taken for a video to achieve trending status.
- Identifying the most popular video categories and user engagement with them.
- Analyzing frequently occurring words in tags and descriptions.

The project was divided into two main sections:

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzing the ratio of likes to dislikes in different categories.
- Determining user preferences for video categories.
- Identifying the top 5 trending videos in each country.
- Investigating the correlation between likes and video trendiness.
- Analyzing the maximum number of days taken for a video to become trending.
- Identifying user engagement with video categories and comments.

## Data Cleaning
- Addressing data type inconsistencies.
- Handling missing values in the dataset.
